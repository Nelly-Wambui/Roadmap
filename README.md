# Roadmap
**Tools of Computational Biology to the World**

The Bioinformatics training will get you ready to analyze and also interpret biological data. 
Our goal is to ensure that those who go through the training successfully become good bioinformaticians.

**What Needs To Be DOne?**

As our roadmap, this will help us get to work on the problems we are facing to ensure the training is seamless.

**Milestone**:
Access to application portal

The portal has had an issue as some times it is not active.

**Milestone**:
Lack of an up to date website

The information on the website needs updating and more life for the readers to enjoy

**Milestone**:
Shallow information on the training

There is need to expound on what the training offers and specify durations especially for those with prior knowledge on bioinformatics

***Already Covered Milestones***

-Insecurity in Training location (May 2017)

-Less desktops, more applicants (February 2018)
